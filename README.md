# Pixel_Pebble_Watchface


This is my first attempt at working with the pebble watch. This specific project is a watch face that I designed to show the date, 
weather, battery level, and watch (analog). My approach for this project was to create a fun little watch face that visualy looked 
like it cam from 8 bit video games.
